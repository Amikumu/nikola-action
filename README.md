# getnikola/nikola-action: a GitHub Action for building a Nikola site and deploying it to GitHub Pages.

This GitHub Action can build and deploy a Nikola website.

# Usage

1. Create a repository with a Nikola site.
2. Configure [nikola github_deploy](https://getnikola.com/handbook.html#deploying-to-github). Itâ€™s best to do your first deployment from your local machine.
3. Ensure the correct branch for deployment is set on GitHub. Refer to [this guide](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages#%EF%B8%8F-first-deployment-with-github_token).
4. Create a `.github/workflows/main.yml` file with the Sample Workflow.

## Sample Workflow

```yml
on: [push]

jobs:
  nikola_build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: 'Deploy Nikola to GitHub Pages'
    steps:
    - name: Check out
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Build and Deploy Nikola
      uses: getnikola/nikola-action@v1
```

## Extras

By default, the action will install the latest stable release of `Nikola[extras]`. If you want to use the bleeding-edge version from `master`, or want to install some extra dependencies, you can provide a `requirements.txt` file in the repository.
